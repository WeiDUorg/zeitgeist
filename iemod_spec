Specification of the IEMOD file format

Version 0.9.0

The IEMOD format is intended to be a platform-independent distribution
format for modifications for games using the Infinity Engine, using
WeiDU for installation.

An IEMOD file is a ZIP archive using either no compression or
compression with the DEFLATE algorithm. The file must have the
extension ".iemod" and the archive must not span multiple files or be
segmented, nor shall it be encrypted.

Of the files contained within the archive, there must be a WeiDU TP2
file either in the toplevel or within a directory that is itself
located in the toplevel. If the TP2 file is located within a
directory, its file name must exactly match the name of the directory.

The IEMOD file must not include file or directory names containing
characters listed in table forbidden-characters, or files listed in
table forbidden-files and it must not, in its toplevel, contain
directories listed in table toplevel-dirs, or files listed in table
toplevel-files.

The IEMOD file may exclude files and directories listed in table
may-exclude.
